# Epic POC: Complete Worksheet Layout & Generation System

**Epic Goal:** Implement the complete heart of WorksheetGenerator.AI - AI-powered worksheet generation with comprehensive layout variety and professional PDF output - while maintaining all existing Epic 0 mock data interactions. This enhanced POC validates the complete educational value proposition (2-3 hour manual process to 10-15 second AI-generated output WITH pedagogical variety) and proves technical feasibility of layout system before investing in authentication, subscriptions, and business model features.

**Strategic Enhancement:** Layout system moved to POC Epic to validate complete pedagogical differentiation early - the true competitive advantage that will drive teacher adoption and subscription conversion.

**Implementation Status:** Story POC.1 completed with full Google Gemini API integration, HTML generation, and comprehensive testing. Ready for PDF generation implementation in POC.2.
