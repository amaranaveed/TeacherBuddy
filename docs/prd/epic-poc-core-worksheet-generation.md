# Epic POC: Core Worksheet Generation Proof of Concept

**Epic Goal:** Implement the heart of the application - AI-powered worksheet generation with professional PDF output - while maintaining all existing Epic 0 mock data interactions. This POC validates the core value proposition (2-3 hour manual process to 10-15 second AI-generated output) and proves technical feasibility of 5-7 second generation times with curriculum-aligned content before investing in authentication, subscriptions, and business model features.

## Story POC.1: AI-Powered Worksheet Generation Pipeline

As a UK primary school teacher,
I want to generate curriculum-aligned math worksheets using AI with the existing mock interface,
so that I can validate the core worksheet generation functionality works with real PDF output while maintaining familiar configuration options.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Google Gemini API integration configured with environment variables and error handling
2. Mock data (topics, subtopics, difficulty levels) feeds into AI prompt generation system
3. Curriculum-aligned prompt templates generate UK National Curriculum appropriate content
4. Student names from selected mock name lists seamlessly integrate into worksheet questions
5. Generated worksheets contain age-appropriate UK curriculum math problems with proper terminology
6. AI output produces valid HTML structure suitable for PDF conversion
7. Error handling provides graceful fallbacks with user-friendly messaging
8. Content quality maintains educational standards and curriculum alignment
9. Question types vary appropriately (word problems, calculations, visual problems)
10. Generated content avoids cultural bias and uses UK-specific contexts

## Story POC.2: Professional PDF Generation & Download

As a UK primary school teacher,
I want to download professionally formatted PDF worksheets,
so that I can print and distribute high-quality materials in my classroom.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Serverless PDF generation using Puppeteer in Next.js API route
2. HTML-to-PDF conversion maintains consistent formatting across question types
3. Professional A4 formatting with proper margins, headers, and educational styling
4. Worksheet includes curriculum alignment information (Year Group, Topic, Subtopic)
5. Generated PDFs optimized for standard classroom printing
6. PDF file naming includes timestamp and curriculum details for teacher organization
7. Page breaks occur naturally without splitting questions inappropriately
8. PDFs include space for student name and date fields
9. Download functionality provides immediate access to generated worksheets
10. PDF quality remains consistent across different browsers and devices

## Story POC.3: Performance-Optimized Generation Workflow

As a UK primary school teacher,
I want worksheets to generate in 5-7 seconds consistently,
so that I can quickly create multiple worksheets during my limited planning sessions.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. End-to-end generation time (click to downloadable PDF) consistently under 7 seconds
2. Progress indicator shows accurate generation status during AI processing
3. Optimized prompt engineering for speed without sacrificing curriculum alignment
4. Concurrent generation handling for multiple simultaneous requests
5. Performance monitoring and logging for optimization insights
6. Caching strategies for prompt templates and static assets
7. Fallback mechanisms prevent infinite loading states during API timeouts
8. Error recovery mechanisms maintain user experience during failures
9. Generation workflow handles network interruptions gracefully
10. Performance remains consistent during varying load conditions

## Story POC.4: Seamless UI Integration with Mock Data

As a UK primary school teacher,
I want the existing dashboard interface to work identically with real worksheet generation,
so that I can use the familiar configuration options while getting actual professional worksheets.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. All existing Epic 0 mock dropdowns (topics, subtopics, name lists) continue functioning unchanged
2. Generate/Regenerate button logic preserved with real API integration
3. Configuration changes reset preview state and show ads in right panel
4. Preview panel displays real generated worksheet content instead of mock preview
5. Download button appears only after successful generation completion
6. Progress indicator during generation provides meaningful feedback
7. Configuration persistence maintained for regeneration scenarios
8. Error states integrate smoothly with existing UI patterns
9. Mobile and tablet responsiveness preserved during generation workflow
10. All existing UI interactions and state management continue working seamlessly

## Story POC.5: Reusable Architecture Foundation

As a developer,
I want to build the POC with architecture patterns that support future Epic development,
so that the worksheet generation core can seamlessly integrate with authentication, subscriptions, and advertising features.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Service layer abstraction enables easy extension for future Epic requirements
2. TypeScript interfaces prepared for user authentication integration (Epic 1)
3. Configuration management ready for subscription tier limitations (Epic 3)
4. API route structure supports future usage tracking and rate limiting
5. Error handling patterns consistent across planned Epic implementations  
6. Modular architecture separates AI services, PDF generation, and curriculum logic
7. Database schema preparation for user profiles and usage tracking
8. Testing framework established for unit, integration, and E2E testing
9. Environment variable management scalable for additional API integrations
10. Code organization supports rapid development with Claude Code assistance
