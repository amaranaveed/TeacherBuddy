# Epic: Worksheet Quality Enhancement - Brownfield Enhancement

## Epic Goal

Establish comprehensive quality assurance and testing framework for worksheet generation, ensuring consistently exceptional output quality through systematic testing, monitoring, and continuous improvement mechanisms that build upon the existing unified PromptService foundation.

## Epic Description

**Existing System Context:**

- Current relevant functionality: Unified PromptService with consolidated USP.1 and USP.2 functionality for LLM-driven worksheet generation using Gemini 2.5 Flash
- Technology stack: Next.js, TypeScript, Vitest, Playwright, existing qualityAssurance.ts and abTesting.ts services
- Integration points: gemini.ts service, generate-worksheet API route, PDF generation pipeline

**Enhancement Details:**

- What's being added/changed: Comprehensive quality testing framework, automated quality scoring, iterative prompt improvement capabilities, and production-scale monitoring
- How it integrates: Builds on existing qualityAssurance.ts and abTesting.ts services, extends current test suite, integrates with existing worksheet generation pipeline
- Success criteria: Achieve ≥4.5/5.0 quality scores, 98%+ generation success rate, comprehensive quality regression prevention

## Stories

1. **Story WQ.1:** Quality Testing Pipeline & Automated Scoring System
   - Implement comprehensive automated quality scoring using the existing 5-metric framework (Visual Appeal, Educational Appropriateness, SVG Integration, UK Curriculum Alignment, Accessibility)
   - Extend existing qualityAssurance.ts service with automated validation
   - Integrate quality gates into the worksheet generation pipeline

2. **Story WQ.2:** Iterative Prompt Improvement Framework  
   - Build systematic prompt optimization capabilities using existing abTesting.ts foundation
   - Implement feedback loops for continuous prompt refinement
   - Create teacher feedback integration system for real-world validation

3. **Story WQ.3:** Production Quality Monitoring & Continuous Improvement
   - Implement real-time quality monitoring dashboard
   - Create automated quality regression prevention
   - Establish long-term improvement tracking and competitive benchmarking

## Compatibility Requirements

- [x] Existing APIs remain unchanged (generate-worksheet route maintains same interface)
- [x] Database schema changes are backward compatible (no database changes required)
- [x] UI changes follow existing patterns (quality indicators follow existing Radix UI components)
- [x] Performance impact is minimal (quality checks run asynchronously where possible)

## Risk Mitigation

- **Primary Risk:** Quality checks could slow down worksheet generation affecting user experience
- **Mitigation:** Implement asynchronous quality scoring with immediate worksheet delivery, fallback to existing generation if quality service fails
- **Rollback Plan:** Feature flags allow instant rollback to current generation without quality checks, existing services remain fully functional

## Definition of Done

- [x] All stories completed with acceptance criteria met
- [x] Existing functionality verified through testing (no regression in current worksheet generation)
- [x] Integration points working correctly (seamless integration with gemini.ts and PDF pipeline)
- [x] Documentation updated appropriately (quality framework documentation)
- [x] No regression in existing features (comprehensive regression testing)

## Technical Architecture Integration

**Existing Services to Extend:**
- `src/lib/services/qualityAssurance.ts` - Core quality validation logic
- `src/lib/services/abTesting.ts` - A/B testing and optimization framework
- `src/lib/services/gemini.ts` - LLM service integration point

**New Components:**
- Quality scoring algorithms for automated assessment
- Real-time monitoring dashboard components
- Teacher feedback collection system
- Prompt optimization tracking system

**Integration Points:**
- Generate-worksheet API route for quality gate integration
- PDF generation pipeline for quality validation
- Existing test suite extension (Vitest + Playwright)
- Current dropdown configuration system for quality preferences

## Implementation Considerations

**Performance Optimization:**
- Quality checks run asynchronously to maintain generation speed
- Cached quality results for similar worksheet configurations
- Progressive quality enhancement without blocking user flow

**Backward Compatibility:**
- All existing worksheet generation paths remain functional
- Quality enhancement is additive, not replacing existing functionality
- Gradual rollout using existing patterns and infrastructure

**Testing Strategy:**
- Extends existing Vitest unit tests and Playwright E2E tests
- Quality-specific test scenarios for comprehensive coverage
- Integration testing with existing worksheet generation flows

## Success Metrics

- **Quality Excellence:** ≥4.5/5.0 average quality score
- **Generation Reliability:** 98%+ success rate maintained
- **Performance:** No degradation in worksheet generation time
- **Teacher Satisfaction:** Quality improvements measurable through feedback
- **System Stability:** Zero regression in existing functionality

## Story Manager Handoff

**Story Manager Handoff:**

"Please develop detailed user stories for this brownfield epic. Key considerations:

- This is an enhancement to an existing system running Next.js, TypeScript, with Gemini 2.5 Flash LLM integration
- Integration points: gemini.ts service, qualityAssurance.ts service, abTesting.ts service, generate-worksheet API route, PDF generation pipeline
- Existing patterns to follow: Radix UI components, Vitest/Playwright testing, existing service architecture patterns
- Critical compatibility requirements: No breaking changes to existing APIs, maintain current generation performance, preserve all existing functionality
- Each story must include verification that existing worksheet generation remains intact and performs as expected

The epic should maintain system integrity while delivering comprehensive quality assurance capabilities for worksheet generation excellence."
