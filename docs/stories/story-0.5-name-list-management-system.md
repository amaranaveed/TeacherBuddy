# Story 0.5: Name List Management System

**Status:** Done

**Story:** As a UK primary school teacher, I want to create and manage student name lists, so that I can personalize worksheets for my different classes.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Name list management page accessible from navigation
2. List view showing all saved name lists with mock data:
   - "Year 3 Class A" (25 names)
   - "Year 4 Maths Group" (18 names)
   - "Reception Class" (20 names)
3. Create new name list modal with:
   - Name list title input
   - Add/remove name functionality
   - Bulk import textarea option
   - Save/cancel buttons
4. Edit existing name list functionality
5. Delete name list with confirmation dialog
6. Default UK name list provided with common primary school names:
   - Emma, Oliver, Ava, George, Isla, Noah, Sophia, Leo, Lily, Arthur
   - Grace, Oscar, Freya, Archie, Charlotte, Jack, Amelia, Harry, Emily, Henry
7. Name list selector in main interface showing saved lists
8. Info tooltip explaining how names are used in worksheet questions
9. Validation for name list requirements (minimum names, appropriate names)
10. Search/filter functionality for large name lists
11. Export name list functionality (CSV format)
12. Mobile-responsive design for classroom use

## Dev Notes

- Use shadcn/ui components throughout for consistency with existing interface
- Implement with React Hook Form for modal forms and validation
- Use Zustand store for name list state management
- Mock data should represent realistic UK primary school class names
- Follow established coding standards for component structure and naming
- Ensure accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA) with proper focus management
- Integration with main worksheet generation interface name list selector

### Architecture Context
- Name lists stored in mock local state initially (prepare for future database integration)
- State management should integrate seamlessly with existing worksheet generation flow
- Component should be accessible from main navigation and integrate with existing auth context
- Export functionality should prepare for future cloud storage integration

### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for all CRUD operations
- Integration tests with main worksheet interface
- E2E tests for complete name list creation and usage workflow
- Responsive design testing across all viewport sizes
- Accessibility testing with keyboard navigation and screen readers
- Form validation testing including edge cases
