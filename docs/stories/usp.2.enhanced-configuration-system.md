## Dev Notes

### Configuration Flow Enhancement
**Optimized Teacher Workflow:** 
1. Year Group selection (simplified, age-focused)
2. Topic selection (visually organized, curriculum-aligned)
3. Smart defaults applied automatically
4. Advanced options available via progressive disclosure
5. Real-time preview of configuration impact

**Integration with LLM System:**
- Configuration selections directly map to prompt template parameters
- Enhanced options influence LLM instruction specificity
- Smart defaults ensure optimal prompt selection for quality output

### UI/UX Design Principles
**Teacher-Centric Design:**
- Reduced cognitive load through smart defaults
- Contextual suggestions based on educational best practices
- Progressive disclosure of advanced options
- Clear visual hierarchy and intuitive flow

**Research Integration:**
- Configuration sequence based on teacher decision patterns
- Options validated through educational research
- Defaults optimized for curriculum alignment and student engagement

### State Management Architecture
**Enhanced State Structure:**
```typescript
interface EnhancedWorksheetConfig {
  // Existing fields maintained
  yearGroup: string;
  topic: string;
  subtopic: string;
  layout: string;
  difficulty: string;
  questionCount: number;
  
  // Simplified enhanced options
  visualTheme?: 'animals' | 'food' | 'sports' | 'space' | 'standard';
  studentNameList?: string[];
  promptTemplate: 'A' | 'B' | 'C';
}
```

### Smart Defaults Logic
**Age-Appropriate Visual Themes:**
- Reception/Year 1: Animal themes as default suggestion
- Year 3+: Standard themes as default
- All themes remain optional - no forced defaults

**Student Name Integration:**
- Optional student name list under enhanced options
- Names integrated into worksheet content when provided
- Maintains privacy - names not stored permanently

## Testing

### Configuration Flow Testing
**User Experience Testing:**
- Teacher journey mapping and usability validation
- A/B testing of configuration flows
- Accessibility testing for all user types
- Mobile responsiveness validation

**Integration Testing:**
- Configuration → LLM prompt mapping validation
- All option combinations produce valid prompts
- State management consistency across selections
- Form validation accuracy for all combinations

**Regression Testing:**
- Existing workflows remain unchanged
- Current user configurations continue working
- Performance impact assessment
- Backward compatibility validation

## Success Metrics

### User Experience Targets
- **Configuration Time Reduction:** 30% faster worksheet creation
- **Teacher Satisfaction:** >85% approval of new configuration flow
- **Error Rate Reduction:** 50% fewer invalid configuration attempts
- **Feature Adoption:** >60% usage of enhanced options within 30 days

### Technical Performance Targets
- **Load Time:** Configuration interface loads in <2 seconds
- **Response Time:** Smart suggestions appear in <500ms
- **Validation Speed:** Form validation feedback in <200ms
- **No Regression:** 100% backward compatibility maintained
