# Story USP.2: Enhanced Configuration System

**Epic:** Epic USP - Professional Worksheet Generation Enhancement  
**Status:** Ready for Implementation  
**Phase:** 2 - Configuration Enhancement  
**Effort:** 2-3 weeks  
**Dependencies:** USP.1 (LLM Prompt Engineering Foundation)  

## Story

**As a** teacher creating worksheets,  
**I want** an intuitive, research-backed configuration flow with optimal sequencing and teacher-friendly options,  
**so that** I can quickly create engaging, professional worksheets without feeling overwhelmed by choices.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Teacher-Optimized Sequence:** Redesign configuration flow based on USP.1 research findings for optimal teacher decision-making workflow
2. **Enhanced Configuration Options:** Add new research-backed options (visual themes, problem types, engagement elements) integrated with existing layout system
3. **Smart Defaults & Suggestions:** Implement intelligent defaults and contextual suggestions based on selections (e.g., layout recommendations for specific topics)
4. **Existing Dropdown Hierarchy:** Enhance Year Group → Topics → Subtopics flow while maintaining current dependency logic
5. **Component Pattern Consistency:** New configuration options follow existing Select component patterns and state management architecture
6. **Layout Template Integration:** Expand current LAYOUT_TEMPLATES system with enhanced option mapping for LLM prompt selection
7. **Professional Output Consistency:** Configuration changes result in consistently professional worksheet output across all combinations
8. **Enhanced Form Validation:** Update validation to handle new options while maintaining existing validation patterns
9. **No Regression Policy:** Current users can continue using familiar workflow without disruption

## Technical Integration

- **Integrates with:** Dashboard configuration UI (src/app/dashboard/page.tsx), existing dropdown components, state management system
- **Technology:** React Select components, existing validation system, layout templates integration, LLM prompt mapping
- **Follows pattern:** Current configuration state management and form validation patterns
- **Touch points:** Configuration dropdowns, option dependencies, validation feedback, prompt template selection
- **New components:** Enhanced option selectors, smart suggestion engine, contextual help system

## Dev Notes

### Configuration Flow Enhancement
**Optimized Teacher Workflow:** 
1. Year Group selection (simplified, age-focused)
2. Topic selection (visually organized, curriculum-aligned)
3. Smart defaults applied automatically
4. Advanced options available via progressive disclosure
5. Real-time preview of configuration impact

**Integration with LLM System:**
- Configuration selections directly map to prompt template parameters
- Enhanced options influence LLM instruction specificity
- Smart defaults ensure optimal prompt selection for quality output

### UI/UX Design Principles
**Teacher-Centric Design:**
- Reduced cognitive load through smart defaults
- Contextual suggestions based on educational best practices
- Progressive disclosure of advanced options
- Clear visual hierarchy and intuitive flow

**Research Integration:**
- Configuration sequence based on teacher decision patterns
- Options validated through educational research
- Defaults optimized for curriculum alignment and student engagement

### State Management Architecture
**Enhanced State Structure:**
```typescript
interface EnhancedWorksheetConfig {
  // Existing fields maintained
  yearGroup: string;
  topic: string;
  subtopic: string;
  layout: string;
  difficulty: string;
  questionCount: number;
  
  // New enhanced options
  visualTheme: 'animals' | 'food' | 'sports' | 'space' | 'none';
  problemTypes: string[];
  engagementStyle: 'structured' | 'storytelling' | 'gamified';
  promptTemplate: 'A' | 'B' | 'C';
}
```

### Smart Defaults Logic
**Age-Appropriate Defaults:**
- Reception/Year 1: Visual-heavy layouts, animal themes, structured engagement
- Year 3: Balanced layouts, mixed themes, creative storytelling elements
- Year 5: Content-focused layouts, real-world themes, problem-solving engagement

**Topic-Specific Suggestions:**
- Addition/Subtraction: Counting objects, visual arrays
- Multiplication/Division: Array visualizations, grouping themes
- Fractions: Visual representations, real-world contexts

## Testing

### Configuration Flow Testing
**User Experience Testing:**
- Teacher journey mapping and usability validation
- A/B testing of configuration flows
- Accessibility testing for all user types
- Mobile responsiveness validation

**Integration Testing:**
- Configuration → LLM prompt mapping validation
- All option combinations produce valid prompts
- State management consistency across selections
- Form validation accuracy for all combinations

**Regression Testing:**
- Existing workflows remain unchanged
- Current user configurations continue working
- Performance impact assessment
- Backward compatibility validation

## Success Metrics

### User Experience Targets
- **Configuration Time Reduction:** 30% faster worksheet creation
- **Teacher Satisfaction:** >85% approval of new configuration flow
- **Error Rate Reduction:** 50% fewer invalid configuration attempts
- **Feature Adoption:** >60% usage of enhanced options within 30 days

### Technical Performance Targets
