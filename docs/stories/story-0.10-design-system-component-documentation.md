## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-01

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Excellent Implementation Quality:** The design system documentation implementation demonstrates high-quality React/TypeScript development with comprehensive content coverage. All 7 documentation pages are well-structured, interactive, and provide detailed examples with code snippets. The implementation follows Next.js 14 best practices with proper component composition, consistent styling using Tailwind CSS, and excellent TypeScript typing.

**Standout Features:**
- Interactive component examples with show/hide code functionality (`src/app/components/page.tsx:32-94`)
- Comprehensive design token documentation with visual examples
- Detailed accessibility guidelines with WCAG 2.1 AA compliance information  
- Excellent brand guidelines with UK-specific educational context
- Professional development standards documentation
- Realistic mock data specifications for UK primary education context

### Refactoring Performed
