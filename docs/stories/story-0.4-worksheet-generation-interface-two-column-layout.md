# Story 0.4: Worksheet Generation Interface (Two-Column Layout)

**Status:** Done

**Story:** As a UK primary school teacher, I want an intuitive worksheet generation interface, so that I can efficiently configure and preview worksheets during my planning time.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Two-column responsive layout (30/70 split on desktop - 30% controls, 70% preview/ads, stacked on mobile)
2. Left panel configuration controls in logical vertical order:
   - Topic dropdown with mock UK curriculum topics
   - Subtopic dropdown (dynamically populated based on topic selection)
   - Difficulty selector (Easy/Average/Hard) as radio buttons
   - Question count slider/selector (5-30 questions)
   - Name list selector with "Create New" button and info tooltip
3. Right panel with conditional content:
   - Ad placeholder during "generation" (mock loading state)
   - Mock worksheet preview after "generation" completion
   - Clean transitions between states
4. Bottom action buttons:
   - Generate button (changes to "Regenerate" when config changes)
   - Download button (appears only when preview is showing)
5. Progress indicator during mock generation (5-7 second simulation)
6. Mock worksheet preview with realistic content:
   - Curriculum-aligned math problems
   - Student names from selected name list
   - Professional formatting and layout
7. Configuration state management:
   - Changes empty preview and show ads
   - Button labels update based on state
   - Visual feedback for all interactions
8. Error states with helpful messaging
9. Loading states that feel realistic but not anxious
10. Responsive design optimized for desktop and tablet use
