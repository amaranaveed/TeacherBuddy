so that **I can systematically compare prompt variants and maintain consistent quality standards across all worksheet configurations**.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Golden reference creation from high-scoring worksheet outputs with metadata tracking
- [x] A/B testing framework compares multiple prompt variants with statistical significance testing
- [x] Batch testing processes multiple configurations with automated quality comparison
- [x] Reference system maintains version control and approval workflow for quality standards
- [x] Quality gates prevent deployment of prompts scoring below configurable thresholds (default ≥7.5 composite)
- [x] Results comparison identifies performance improvements and regressions between prompt versions
- [x] Batch testing supports parallel execution for efficiency
- [x] Comprehensive reporting with statistical analysis and recommendations

## Technical Requirements

### Golden Reference Management
```bash
# Create golden reference from high-scoring output
./worksheet-engine --create-golden --config="year3-addition-standard-average-5q" --source="./results/test-001/worksheet.pdf" --approve

# Update golden reference set from approved outputs
./worksheet-engine --update-golden-set --batch-approved="./approved-outputs/"
