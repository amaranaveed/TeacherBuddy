3. **Quality Regression Prevention:** Automated detection and prevention of quality degradation during prompt evolution cycles
4. **Production-Scale E2E Testing:** Comprehensive testing across all configuration combinations with real-time quality scoring and feedback collection
5. **Prompt Effectiveness Analytics:** Detailed tracking of which prompt elements, themes, and structures drive highest quality scores for data-driven improvement
6. **Automated Quality Gate Enforcement:** Prevent prompts scoring <4.5/5.0 from reaching production while maintaining continuous improvement cycles
7. **Multi-Dimensional Quality Scoring:** Advanced scoring across visual appeal, educational value, SVG integration, curriculum alignment, and accessibility with iterative improvement tracking
8. **Teacher Feedback Integration:** Direct teacher feedback collection and integration into prompt improvement cycles for real-world validation
9. **Performance-Optimized Feedback Loops:** Fast quality assessment providing immediate feedback for rapid prompt iteration cycles
