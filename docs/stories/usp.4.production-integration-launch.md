## Dev Notes

### Production Architecture Integration
**LLM System Integration:**
```
Configuration → Feature Flag Check → LLM Prompt Engine → Gemini 2.5 Flash → Quality Validation → HTML Output → PDF Generation
                     ↓
                 Traditional Path (Fallback)
```

**Deployment Strategy:**
- Feature flags enable gradual rollout (10% → 25% → 50% → 100%)
- A/B testing compares LLM vs. traditional generation quality
- Real-time monitoring ensures performance and quality maintenance
- Instant rollback capability if issues detected

### Performance Optimization Strategy
**Caching Implementation:**
- Common configuration → prompt template mapping cached
- Frequently used prompts pre-compiled for faster generation
- PDF generation optimized for LLM HTML output structure

**Error Handling:**
- LLM API failures automatically fall back to traditional generation
- Quality score monitoring triggers alerts for score degradation
- Automatic retry logic with exponential backoff

### Quality Assurance in Production
**Real-Time Quality Monitoring:**
- Automated quality scoring on generated worksheets
- Performance metrics tracking (generation time, success rate)
- User satisfaction feedback integration
- Competitive advantage tracking through teacher surveys
