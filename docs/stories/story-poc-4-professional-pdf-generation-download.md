**Epic:** POC - Complete Worksheet Layout & Generation System  
**Story ID:** POC.4  
**Priority:** High  
**Status:** Draft  

## Story
As a UK primary school teacher,

so that I can print and distribute high-quality materials optimized for different mathematical learning objectives.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Serverless PDF generation using Puppeteer supports all 5 layout templates
2. Layout-specific HTML-to-PDF conversion maintains consistent formatting
3. Professional A4 formatting with proper margins, headers, and layout-appropriate styling
4. Layout templates: Standard Questions, Two-Column Fluency, Grid/Table, Differentiated (Mild/Medium/Hot), Reasoning Boxes
5. Generated PDFs optimized for standard classroom printing across all layouts
6. PDF file naming includes layout type and curriculum details for teacher organization
7. Page breaks occur naturally within each layout style without splitting questions inappropriately
8. PDFs include space for student name and date fields appropriate to layout
9. Download functionality provides immediate access to generated worksheets
10. PDF quality remains consistent across different browsers, devices, and layout types

## Dev Notes

**Dependencies:**
- Story POC.2 completion (Layout Template System) ✅ - Verified: `src/lib/templates/layouts.ts` contains all 5 layout templates
- Story POC.3 completion (UI Integration) ✅ - UI integration completed with layout selector
- Existing worksheet generation pipeline - Uses Gemini API with HTML rendering
- HTML templates from layout system - All 5 layouts (standard, fluency, grid, differentiated, reasoning) implemented

**Security Requirements (CRITICAL):**

**Authentication & Authorization:**
- PDF generation endpoint MUST be protected by authentication middleware
- Only authenticated users can access `/api/worksheets/generate-pdf`
- User session validation required before PDF processing
- User ID logged for audit trails and usage tracking
- Implement authentication check using existing auth patterns

**Input Validation & Sanitization:**
- All worksheet content sanitized using existing `escapeHtml()` function from layouts.ts:27-34
- Layout parameters validated against `LayoutType` enum: standard | fluency | grid | differentiated | reasoning
- Zod schemas enforce input structure with `PdfGenerationRequest` interface
- HTML entities escaped in all user-generated content before PDF generation
- Question content validated to prevent XSS injection

**Data Privacy & GDPR Compliance:**
- NO student personal data stored in PDF metadata or server logs
- Generated PDFs not cached on server - immediate cleanup after download
- PDF filenames use curriculum identifiers only: `{Subject}_{Topic}_{Layout}_{Timestamp}.pdf`
- Temporary PDF files deleted within 2 minutes of generation
- No personal data in PDF generation audit logs
- GDPR-compliant data handling for UK teachers

**Rate Limiting & Resource Protection:**
- Maximum 5 PDF generations per user per 3-minute window
- Queue system prevents server overload during peak usage
- Timeout protection: 45-second limit per PDF generation
- Resource monitoring for unusual usage patterns
- Exponential backoff for repeated failures

**Key Technical Requirements:**

**Verified Layout Templates (from src/lib/templates/layouts.ts):**
- Standard Questions: Sequential numbered questions with working lines and answer boxes
- Two-Column Fluency: 3-column grid layout with arithmetic problems and answer spaces
- Grid/Table: Multiplication grids and number lines with deterministic seeded random
- Differentiated: Mild/Medium/Hot sections with color-coded borders and themed icons
- Reasoning Boxes: Bordered question boxes with thinking sections and final answer areas

**Puppeteer Configuration:**
- Serverless-compatible Puppeteer setup for Vercel environment
- A4 page format (210 × 297 mm) matching existing layout base template
- Print margins: 20mm (matching existing layouts.ts:71 padding)
- Print CSS media queries support (existing @media print rules in layouts.ts:120-127)
- Headless Chrome configuration optimized for serverless functions

**PDF Template Integration:**
- Use existing `renderLayout()` function from layouts.ts:552-564
- Leverage existing `baseLayoutTemplate` with proper headers and student info fields
- Maintain existing HTML escape security from layouts.ts:27-34
- Preserve existing print optimization styles

**File Naming Convention:**
Format: `Maths_{Topic}_{Layout}_{Timestamp}.pdf` (no student data)
Example: `Maths_Addition_Standard_20240115143022.pdf`

**Technical Architecture:**
- API Route: `/api/worksheets/generate-pdf` (POST endpoint with auth middleware)
- Service: `lib/services/pdfGenerationService.ts` (new service layer)
- Templates: Use existing `src/lib/templates/layouts.ts` renderLayout function
- Types: Extend existing `WorksheetConfig` from `src/lib/types/worksheet.ts`
- Integration: Connect with existing Gemini service and layout system

**Print Optimization:**
- Font sizes: 12pt minimum (matches existing layouts.ts:68)
- High contrast colors: black text on white background (existing default)
- Avoid thin lines that may not print clearly
- Ensure sufficient white space for student work (existing layouts provide this)
- Page break optimization for each layout type (existing page-break-inside: avoid rules)

### Testing

**Testing Standards:**
- Test files location: `tests/integration/pdf-generation.test.ts`
- PDF validation using pdf-parse library
- Visual regression testing for layout consistency
- Cross-platform PDF rendering verification

**Test Scenarios:**
1. PDF generation for each of the 5 layout types using existing templates
2. Security testing: authentication required, input sanitization, rate limiting
3. File naming accuracy: `Maths_{Topic}_{Layout}_{Timestamp}.pdf` format
4. Page break behavior: verify existing CSS page-break rules work in PDF
5. Download functionality across different browsers and devices
6. Print quality validation: A4 format, proper margins, classroom printer compatibility
7. Privacy validation: no student data in metadata or logs
8. Performance testing: PDF generation under 45 seconds, cleanup within 2 minutes

**Validation Methods:**
- PDF structural validation using pdf-parse library (pages, fonts, text extraction)
- Security validation: authentication bypass attempts, XSS injection tests
- Visual comparison testing for layout consistency across all 5 templates
- File size optimization verification (target < 2MB per PDF)
- Privacy audit: metadata inspection, log file review
- Classroom printer compatibility testing with actual HP/Canon printers
- Rate limiting validation: exceed limits and verify proper error responses
