# Story 1.1: Year Group Integration for Worksheet Generation

**Epic:** Epic 1 - Foundation Authentication Infrastructure
**Status:** Ready for Review
**Priority:** Critical
**Estimated Effort:** 3 days

## Story
As a UK primary school teacher,
I want the worksheet generation to start with Year Group selection as the primary driver of all configuration options,
so that the Topic and Subtopic dropdowns are curriculum-aligned and guide me through age-appropriate content selection for my specific year group.

## Problem Statement
Currently, the worksheet generation system uses generic topics and subtopics that aren't aligned with specific year group curricula. Teachers need a guided, curriculum-aligned configuration flow where Year Group selection drives available Topics, and Topic selection drives relevant Subtopics, ensuring all content matches their students' exact learning level and curriculum requirements.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Curriculum-Aligned UI Flow
- [x] **AC1:** Year Group dropdown appears FIRST in configuration panel, above all other options
- [x] **AC2:** Year Group from profile is pre-selected as default in dropdown
- [x] **AC3:** Topic dropdown is populated based on selected Year Group's curriculum
- [x] **AC4:** Topic dropdown is disabled until Year Group is selected
- [x] **AC5:** Subtopic dropdown is populated based on selected Year Group + Topic combination
- [x] **AC6:** Subtopic dropdown is disabled until both Year Group and Topic are selected
- [x] **AC7:** Clear visual hierarchy: Year Group → Topic → Subtopic → Other options

### Curriculum Mapping Enhancement  
- [x] **AC8:** Year-specific curriculum mapping defines available Topics per year group
- [x] **AC9:** Topic-specific subtopic mapping provides relevant options for each Year Group + Topic
- [x] **AC10:** AI prompt generation uses specific Year Group instead of generic "Primary Years 1-6"
- [x] **AC11:** Generated worksheets display specific year (e.g., "Year 3 Mathematics") in headers
- [x] **AC12:** Question difficulty and complexity align with selected Year Group's curriculum standards

### User Experience & Guidance
- [x] **AC13:** Configuration panel provides curriculum guidance through dropdown dependencies
- [x] **AC14:** Clear visual indication when Year Group changes from profile default
- [x] **AC15:** Tooltip/help text explains curriculum alignment and dropdown dependencies
- [x] **AC16:** Validation prevents generation if Year Group, Topic, or Subtopic missing
- [x] **AC17:** Progressive disclosure: only show relevant options based on previous selections

### Technical Requirements
- [x] **AC18:** Update WorksheetConfig type to include mandatory yearGroup field
- [x] **AC19:** Modify getCurriculumContext() to use specific year group data
- [x] **AC20:** Enhance prompt generation to include year-specific contexts and expectations
- [x] **AC21:** Update API validation to require yearGroup parameter
- [x] **AC22:** Create curriculum mapping data structure: YearGroup → Topics → Subtopics
- [x] **AC23:** Implement dropdown dependency logic in frontend components
- [x] **AC24:** Add API endpoints for curriculum-based dropdown options

## Dev Notes

### Current Issues Identified
1. **Non-Curriculum UI Flow:** Configuration panel doesn't guide users through curriculum-aligned selections
2. **Independent Dropdowns:** Topic and Subtopic options aren't filtered by Year Group selection
3. **Missing Curriculum Hierarchy:** No Year Group → Topic → Subtopic dependency structure
4. **Poor User Guidance:** Teachers must guess which topics/subtopics align with their year group

### Technical Implementation

#### 1. Type Updates
```typescript
// Update WorksheetConfig interface
interface WorksheetConfig {
  topic: string
  subtopic: string  
  difficulty: DifficultyLevel
  questionCount: number
  yearGroup: string // Make mandatory
  studentNames: string[]
}
```

#### 2. Curriculum-Aligned UI Implementation
- **Year Group First:** Position Year Group dropdown at the top of configuration panel
- **Dependent Dropdowns:** Topic dropdown populated based on Year Group selection
- **Progressive Disclosure:** Subtopic dropdown populated based on Year Group + Topic
- **Disabled States:** Topic disabled until Year Group selected, Subtopic until both selected
- **Profile Integration:** Pre-populate Year Group from user profile
- **Visual Hierarchy:** Clear Year Group → Topic → Subtopic → Other Options flow

#### 3. Curriculum Data Structure
```typescript
// New curriculum hierarchy structure
interface CurriculumMapping {
  [yearGroup: string]: {
    topics: {
      [topic: string]: {
        subtopics: string[]
        learningObjectives: string[]
        complexity: string
      }
    }
  }
}

const curriculumData: CurriculumMapping = {
  'Year 3': {
    topics: {
      'Number and Place Value': {
        subtopics: ['Numbers to 1000', 'Comparing Numbers', 'Rounding'],
        learningObjectives: ['Count from 0 in multiples of 4, 8, 50, 100'],
        complexity: 'Age 7-8 appropriate'
      },
      'Addition and Subtraction': {
        subtopics: ['Mental Methods', 'Written Methods', 'Problem Solving'],
        learningObjectives: ['Add/subtract numbers with up to 3 digits'],
        complexity: 'Concrete then abstract'
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### 4. Prompt Engineering
- Replace generic "Primary Years 1-6" with specific year (e.g., "Year 3")  
- Include year-specific learning expectations in prompts
- Adjust question complexity based on year group
- Use age-appropriate contexts and scenarios

### Year Group Curriculum Mapping
```typescript
const yearGroupMapping = {
  'Reception': {
    ageRange: '4-5 years',
    mathFocus: 'Numbers to 10, basic counting, shapes',
    complexity: 'Very simple, visual-heavy'
  },
  'Year 1': {
    ageRange: '5-6 years', 
    mathFocus: 'Numbers to 20, addition/subtraction to 10',
    complexity: 'Simple language, concrete examples'
  },
  'Year 2': {
    ageRange: '6-7 years',
    mathFocus: 'Numbers to 100, times tables 2, 5, 10',
    complexity: 'Basic word problems, simple reasoning'
  },
  // ... continue for Years 3-6
}
```
