5. **A/B Testing System:** Create prompt variation testing with Template A (Structured), Template B (Creative), Template C (Gamified) approaches for systematic optimization
6. **Iterative Optimization:** Establish version control for prompt evolution with documented performance improvements and change tracking
7. **Competitive Quality Standards:** Generate worksheets that demonstrably outperform existing solutions through superior visual design and educational depth
8. **LLM-Native Architecture:** Configuration → Optimized Prompt → Gemini 2.5 Flash → HTML with embedded SVGs → PDF (no custom SVG services required)
9. **Systematic Input Evaluation:** Test prompt performance across variable matrix (Year Group, Topic, Difficulty, Question Count, Layout Style, Theme) for comprehensive coverage
10. **Educational Excellence:** Ensure generated content maintains UK curriculum alignment with proper mathematical terminology and age-appropriate pedagogical approaches
11. **Scalable Methodology:** Document repeatable prompt engineering process for future expansion to additional year groups and mathematical topics
12. **Performance Metrics:** Achieve ≥95% generation success rate with ≥4.0 average quality scores across all Phase 1 combinations
