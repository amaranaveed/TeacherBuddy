# Introduction

This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for WorksheetGenerator.AI, including backend systems, frontend implementation, and their integration. It serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency across the entire technology stack.

This unified approach combines what would traditionally be separate backend and frontend architecture documents, streamlining the development process for modern fullstack applications where these concerns are increasingly intertwined.

## Starter Template or Existing Project

**N/A - Greenfield project**

Based on analysis of the current project state, this is a greenfield development of WorksheetGenerator.AI with only a basic HTML placeholder file. The PRD clearly specifies the technology choices and architecture:

- **Framework:** Next.js 14+ with App Router
- **UI:** shadcn/ui components with Tailwind CSS  
- **Backend:** Supabase for authentication and database
- **AI:** Google Gemini API for worksheet generation
- **Deployment:** Vercel platform

The project should be built from scratch following these specific technology constraints, rather than using any existing starter template.
